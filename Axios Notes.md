# Executing Code Globally - Interceptors

**Interceptors:** 
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch. They are functions you can define globally 
that will be executed for every request leaving your app, and every response returning into it.

In index.js:

```
axios.interceptors.request.use(requestConfig=> {

});
```
